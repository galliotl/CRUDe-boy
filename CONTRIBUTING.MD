# Contributing

## Process

Start by forking the repo.

We currently don't have any dev branches as all deployment / releases are done by hand. So all you pull requests should be pointing directly to the `master` branch. You'll then need 1 approved review from the code-owners to be merged.

## Commits

In order to have as much of a clean history we use `git rebase` only and we use [conventionnal commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/). A very cool VS Code extension exists to help with that.

## Tests

Use the same tests framework we use (see examples in the test folder). Always add tests to your Pull Requests. We're developping a library it's important to ensure it's working correctly.

## Documentation

Please always document your code, in the root readme if it makes sense to do so, using docstrings, and as much as possible by making your own Github review / Commenting your Pull Request

## Thanks

Big thanks in advance too all of you trying to help us helping others. Open source is about sharing and improving one another. It's actually my first library so these rules are subject to debate as well as the code itself. I'll always listen with an open ear to suggestions :) Don't be cRUDE is all I'm asking ;)
